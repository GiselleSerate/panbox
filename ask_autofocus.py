			['FormBook', 'Unit42.FormBook', 'malware_family', 'InfoStealer', 'FormBook is a data stealer and form grabber that has been advertised in various hacking forums since early 2016. \nThe malware injects itself into various processes and installs function hooks to log keystrokes, steal clipboard contents, and extract data from HTTP sessions. The malware can also execute commands from a command and control (C2) server. The commands include instructing the malware to download and execute files, start processes, shutdown and reboot the system, and steal cookies and local passwords.\n\nOne of the malware\'s most interesting features is that it reads Windowsâ€™ ntdll.dll module from disk into memory, and calls its exported functions directly, rendering user-mode hooking and API monitoring mechanisms ineffective. The malware author calls this technique "Lagos Island method" (allegedly originating from a userland rootkit with this name). \n\nIt also features a persistence method that randomly changes the path, filename, file extension, and the registry key used for persistence. \n\nThe malware author does not sell the builder, but only sells the panel, and then generates the executable files as a service.']]]]
