# PANDORICA (Palo Alto Networks DNS Obsolete Record Interchange Capability Assessment)

Why, exactly, do we swap certain DNS C2 domains in and out of Palo Alto Networks firewalls daily? Pandorica provides insight into this question and others by collecting this data from Palo Alto's daily antivirus release notes, aggregating it, and displaying it in Kibana dashboards.

Consult the [wiki](https://github.com/GiselleSerate/pandorica/wiki) for further documentation.
