AF_POINTS_MODE=False

AF_POINT_NOEXEC=500
#
# Number of seconds to wait when AF_POINT_NOEXEC gets triggered.  This stops all
# app execution and checks the AF points total at the specified interval.  When
# the points total is higher than AF_POINT_NOEXEC it resumes execution.

# Set the number of processes to run the DNS module.  This cannot be more than

# where it is greater than 16 and this should only be adjusted down (never up).
# Remember that DNS_POOL_COUNT and URL_POOL_COUNT have to share the total of 16.

# SafeNetworking caches domain info from AutoFocus.  This setting specifies, in

#
# The Autofocus API isn't the speediest thing on the planet.  Usually, the most
# pertinent info is within the first couple of minutes of query time.  So, set

# finish - which could take 20mins.  No lie....   This is set in minutes
AF_LOOKUP_TIMEOUT=2
#
# The maximum percentage of the AF query we are willing to accept.  If, when we
# check the timer above, the value is greater than this percentage, we bail out
# of the loop.  The lower the number, the more likely that we may not get a
# result.  Though, usually, 2 minutes and 20 percent is enough to get at least
# the latest result.
